# PIC-code
Two-dimensional PIC-code with comparison of two methods for particles examination: CIC(cloud-in-cell) and TSC(triangular-shaped-cloud).
Poisson equation is computed via Multiple-Fourier-transform (MFT). This is reprentation of Hockney and Eastwood numerical results, that shows an unlimited heating of such system.
